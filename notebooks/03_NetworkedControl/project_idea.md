## Digitally Networked Control Systems (NCS)

**1. Notebook:** *Effect of packet drops & delay on an LQR controller*

* Tools: Python, SimPy or a simple event-driven simulator, Matplotlib
* Show: performance degradation vs. packet drop rate, implement simple hold-last-value and predictor.

**2. Project:** *Event-triggered control demo with ROS topics*

* Tools: ROS2 (rclpy), a small simulated plant (Gazebo or simple node)
* Show bandwidth reduction vs. periodic sampling, effect on stability.

**Repo helpers:** TrueTime (MATLAB) for advanced simulation; ROS/ROS2 example repos.
